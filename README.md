# Welcome to MovieNight! ðŸ™Œ

MovieNight is an app for people that prefer watching movies than arguing on titles.

It comes from an idea I had some months ago, after I spent with my girlfriend about two hours choosing a one-and-a-half-hour movie.

I thought we could create a personal movie wishlist (with movies that you want to watch or re-watch), so when you are with your friends or your partner, the app cross-compares the lists and tells which films you both want to watch. Easy peasy.

## Current stage

The application is in its embryo stage - at the moment it has the movie searcher and the "Add to whishlist" feature.
Currently we have four models: *User*, *Profile*, *Movie*, *Wish*, and *Friendship*.
*Wish* represents the film that a *User* wants to watch, it's basically a lookup table between *User* and *Movie*.

When the user logs in and searches for a movie, the *RemoteMoviesController* makes a request to the TMDB api and presents a list with the requested movies. When the user clicks on a movie, we create (if needed) a new record on the *movies* table (caching the *tmdb_id* and the *title*), then we create a new *Wish* that relates the *Movie* with the *User*.

*Profile*: a user is asked to create a Profile with first name, last name and username to add movies on her wishlist.

*Friendship* represent a friendship request: has a sender and a receiver. To represent that the
receiver has confirmed the friendship, we just fill the confirmation date on the friendship,
otherwise remains a pending request.

## Feature roadmap:

* Search for a profile to send a friend request
* Event creation, invite friends
* Comment on events

## Possible features:

* Movie reviews
* Follow people to see updates (reviews, wishlists updates)
* Date-chooser Ã  la Doodle
